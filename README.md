# MLFI
This repo contains 4 group projects developed for the module in Machine Learning in Finance and Insurance at the ETH Zurich.
The project were developed during the HS25 (Fall Semester 2025). Below a short explanation of each project.

DISCLAIMER !
The Python Notebooks in this repo were produced as assignments for a ###group### project. Therefore, I am not the exclusive owner and creator of the files.

## Project 1 - Linear Regression and Regularization
Implementation of linear regression for the prediction of the house prices. The file contains not only the standard regression, but also the regularized version using four different techniques: Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net and Truncated Pseudo Inverse.

## Project 2 - Credit risk modeling on simulated consumer-loan data.
Trained Logistic Regression and kernel SVM to predict repayment probability, evaluated with cross-entropy and AUC, then compared lending strategies via profit/VaR simulation.

## Project 3 - Deep Hedging
Implementation of a deep neural network for hedging purposes. The Neural Network is firstly trained in a Black and Scholes framework to show that the payoff is perfectly replicated in complete markets.
Consequentially, another Neural Network is trained using the Heston model, showing that in incomplete market is not possible to perfectly replicate a payoff.

## Project 4 - Insurance Claim Prediction (French MTPL dataset) 
Insurance claim frequency prediction on the French Motor Third-Party Liability dataset (678k+ policies).
Implemented and compared Poisson GLM, a Poisson neural network, and tree-based methods using exposure-weighted Poisson deviance.
The tree-based methods implemented are: CART, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
